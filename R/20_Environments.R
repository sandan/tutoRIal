# (1) Environment Basics
# An environment's purpose is to bind a set of names with a set of values
# You can think of an environment as a set of names
# each name points to an object stored elsewhere in memory

e <- new.env()
e$a <- FALSE
e$b <- "a"
e$c <- 3.14
e$d <- 4:11

# These names point to objects:
# a -> F
# b -> "a"
# c -> 3.14
# d -> 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11

# The objects on the right hand side don't live in the environment
# so you multiple names can point to the same object
e$a <- e$d

# e$a -> 4:11 <- e$d

# names can also point to different objects with the same values
e$d <- 4:11
# e$d -> 4:11
# e$a -> 411

# If an object has no names pointing to it, then the object gets GC'd

# Every env has a parent. When a variable name is sought, it will look at the current
# env and keeps looking up the hierarchy of parent envs until it can find the name.

# The empty environment is the only environment without a parent environment
# Every environment has the empty environment as an ancestor
# Given an environment, we can't access its child environment

# An environment is similar to a list except :
# 1) every name in a certain environment is unique
list(a = 1, a = 2)
e$a <- 9
e$a <- 10  # overwrite
e$a
# 2) the names in an environment are not ordered
# 3) an environment has a parent
# 4) environments have reference semantics
# - that is, they do not copy-on-modify
# - they're mutable

help(parent.env)

# An environment is made up of 2 components:
# 1) Frame - contains the name-object bindings (behaves like a named list)
help(parent.frame)  # gives you the calling environment (the environment calling the function)
                    # not the frame of the calling environment
# 2) Parent Env

# There are 4 special environments:
# 1) globalenv() - the env in which you currently work
#                - the parent of this env is the last package attached with library() or require()
??globalenv
# 2) baseenv() - the base environment - the env of the base R package. Its parent is the empty env.
??baseenv
# 3) emptyenv() - the ultimate ancestor env, only one without a parent
??emptyenv
# 4) environment() - the current environment (can be used inside functions to get the current env they're in)

# environments form a hierarchy in general, but from the
# user's perspective of loading library/require packages, it is more like a list

help(search)
search() # lists all parents of the global env (the interactive workspace)
# the list is also called the search path because objects in these environments
# can be found from the top-level interactive workspace.

# It returns a character vector that contains one environment for each attached package
# and any other objects that youâ€™ve attach()ed. The elements of the vector are names of the environment

# It also contains a special environment called Autoloads which is used to save memory by only loading
# package objects (like big datasets) when needed. Autoloads sits under base.

# the list is ordered so that
search()[[1]]                # 1 is the globalenv()
search()[[length(search())]] # the last element is the package:base

# you can access an environment on the search list with as.environment()
as.environment(search()[[1]])
ls.str(globalenv())

# The beginning of an R environment looks like:
# emptyenv()
# baseenv()    <--- search()[[length(search())]]
# .
# .
# .
# globalenv()  <--- search()[[1]] <--- you are here  (this is the "top" of the search list)

# loading a package will insert it in between baseenv() and globalenv(), right above globalenv():
library(RUnit)
# emptyenv()
# baseenv()
# .
# .
# .
# RUnit        <--- loaded libs go here
# globalenv()  <--- you are here

# Create a new env: use new.env()
# you can list the variable bindings in an environment with ls()
# you can find the parent environment with parent.env()
help(parent.env)
parent.env(e)   # the default parent provided by new.env() is the environment from
                # which it is called - in this case that's the global environment.
# list all the names in the environment
ls(e)

# the easiest way to modify the bindings in the list is to use $
e$e <- 11
e$e

# by default ls() doesn't show bindings beginning with .
e$.k <- 100
ls(e)
ls(e, all.names = T)  # use all.names to show them

# use ls.str() to view an environment - to show the objects that the names point too as well
str(e)   # not much info on the names and objects (the frame of the environment)
ls.str(e)
ls.str(e, all.names = T)

# In general, given a name, you can extract the value using $, [[, or get/mget
# $ and [[ look only in one environment and return NULL if there is no binding associated with the name.
# get() uses the regular scoping rules and throws an error if the binding is not found.
help(get)
get(".k")    # none found since .k is in e, which is a child of this env
get(".k", envir = e)

e[[".k"]]
e$.k

# Deleting objects
# with a list you can remove an entry by assigning the name/position to NULL
# in environments, assigning to NULL will create a new binding to NULL, instead use rm()
e <- new.env()
e$a <- 1
e$a <- NULL
ls(e, all.names = T)
rm("a", envir = e)
ls(e, all.names = T)
length(c("a")[-1])  # character(0) means empty character vec

# You can determine if a binding exists in an environment with exists().
# Like get(), its default behavior will search the env hierarchy
# you can restrict the search to just the current environment by setting inherits = FALSE

x <- 10                  # this is in globalenv(), e is a child of this env
exists("x", envir = e)   # true since it will search the parent env of e too

# use identical() not ==
identical(globalenv(), environment())  # is global env the same as the current env? T since I'm calling both.
